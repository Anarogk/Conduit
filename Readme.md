
## AsyncIO Streamer

### Description
**AsyncIO Streamer** is a C++ application that leverages the power of Boost.Asio to establish high-performance, asynchronous TCP connections. By deftly managing data flow and employing non-blocking operations, it facilitates efficient communication with remote servers. This project serves as a robust foundation for constructing sophisticated network applications that demand rapid data exchange.

### Technologies
* **C++:**
* **Boost.Asio:** A cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming.

### Features
* **Asynchronous Data Transfer:** Enables non-blocking data transmission and reception.
* **Flexible Buffer Management:** Adapts to varying data sizes and formats.
* **HTTP Support:** Demonstrates basic HTTP request and response handling.
* **Error Handling:** Incorporates error detection and reporting mechanisms.

### Prerequisites
* A C++ compiler with support for C++11 or later.
* Boost.Asio library installed.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-io-streamer.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure Boost.Asio is installed on your system. Refer to the Boost documentation for specific installation instructions.

### Running the Application
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd async-io-streamer
   ```
2. **Compile the code:**
   Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o async_streamer main.cpp -lboost_system -lboost_asio
   ```
   **Tip:** Above commands are not tested, so you may need to modify them according to your system.
3. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./async_streamer
   ```

### Usage
The application connects to the specified server (default: "xx.xx.xx.yy" on port 80) and sends an HTTP GET request. It then receives and processes the response.
