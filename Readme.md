
## Project Overview

### Description
This application is designed to simulate multiple concurrent clients to test the performance of a server under load. It measures response times, and error rates, and provides performance metrics.

### Functionality

* **Client Simulation:**
  * Simulates multiple concurrent clients sending HTTP requests to a specified target server.
  * Distributes client load across multiple threads for optimal performance.
  * Handles asynchronous connections for efficient resource utilization.

* **Performance Metrics:**
  * Calculates and displays key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
    * Total number of requests
    * Number of successful requests
    * Number of failed requests
    * Average response time
    * Error rates
  * Provides detailed statistics for each client thread.

* **Error Handling:**
  * Implements robust error handling for network connections, HTTP requests, and response parsing.
  * Logs errors for debugging and analysis.

* **Load Control:**
  * Offers options to control the load profile, including:
    * Ramp-up period
    * Steady-state period
    * Ramp-down period
    * Number of concurrent clients

* **Response Handling:**
  * Parses HTTP responses to extract relevant information (e.g., status code, content length).
  * Can be customized to handle different response formats (e.g., JSON, XML).

### Usage
1. **Configure:**
   * Set the target server's host and port.
   * Define the number of concurrent clients.
   * Specify load control parameters (optional).
2. **Run:**
   * Execute the application.
   * The application will simulate clients, send requests, and collect performance metrics.
3. **Analyze:**
   * Review the generated performance report.
   * Identify potential bottlenecks or performance issues.

### Dependencies
* Asio C++ library for network programming
* Boost for additional utilities (optional)
* Standard C++ libraries

### Known Issues
* List any known limitations or bugs.

### Future Improvements
* Outline potential enhancements or features for future development.

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/async-io-streamer.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   Ensure Boost.Asio is installed on your system. Refer to the Boost documentation for specific installation instructions.

### Running the Application
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd async-io-streamer
   ```
2. **Compile the code:**
   Use your preferred C++ compiler to compile the code. For example, using g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o async_streamer main.cpp -lboost_system -lboost_asio
   ```
   **Tip:** Above commands are not tested, so you may need to modify them according to your system.
3. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./async_streamer
   ```
